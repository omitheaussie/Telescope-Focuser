This is a project I started as I am a member of the local astronomy club and we hold Star parties for local people to come and see through our telescopes. I found that the focuser on my cheap Celestron 130 SLT telescope was not very capable of focusing accurately. SO I decided to motorise it myself as there was no off the shelf cheap solution.

I designed the plastic components in Unigraphics and used a mini Arduino and a steppter motor to develop the system. THis has now been successfully used in 4 star parties and the 2017 solar eclipse.

Here are the links to some of the videos I have been able to take with my focuser and phone mount:
